to create your first script... 

the most important is always the first line, it will never run without this , called the , " shebang "

#!bin/bash - this is shabang and how all executable code starts

to understand why, maybe go to /bin/bash and look around :) 


#!/bin/bash

YOUR CODE HERE TO EXECUTE


_____________


nothing is required to end a basic code, certain statements need start and end like 

if

fi

this is not required here just , something to consider.

to create text you will want to create

echo " hello world " 



(we can play with colorizing and stuff to later on) 

Now, make this a runable script. then play with it and change it and you have wrote script.
